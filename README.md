# Basic-Implementation-of-a-Food-Delivery-App
Implemented a basic Food Delivery App in Java using Object Oriented Programming and its concepts like inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.

-The application has various different features like restaurant specific menu, cart, discounts, etc.

-You can enter as a restaurant worker/ owner as well as a customer. This can thus be used by a wider audience. It also shows the company's earnings and profit through all the restaurants.

-It includes display feature too where at every step you are shown the proceedings. This nullifies almost all kinds of confusion.
